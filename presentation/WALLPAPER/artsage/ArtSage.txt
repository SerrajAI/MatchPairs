Operation
---------
1) Press F1 for the menu
   - keyboard shortcuts are listed on the menu
   - additional keys: Slideshow(Enter), Next(Spacebar), Previous(Backspace)
                    : Exhibit(Shift+F7), Favorites(Shift+F8), Archive(Shift+F9)
                    : Catalog (doubleclick mouse)
   - mousewheel zoom/navigate option

2) Window
   a) Sizing
      - wrap (W) resizes the window to the image, within the desktop
      - wrap also enables the window autocenter option
      - window presets and manual resizing automatically turn off Wrap
      - wrap restores wrapping from collage and presets
      - wrap off in fullscreen preserves the original window size

   b) Cropping
      - cropping removes everything but the image
      - turn cropping off to expose the window frame and caption
      - for a fixed (unwrapped) window, cropping removes the unused background

   c) Show/Hide and instances
      - Show/Hide applies to the first (or single) instance
      - Single Instance restricts ArtSage to a single instance

   d) Multiple monitors
      - Drag window to establish centering/corral/fullscreen in any monitor
      - Presets can be set/restored to any monitor

3) Image
   a) Scaling (% in status bar)
      - squeeze, shrink and stretch are variable zoom settings
        . squeeze scales the image down to fit the window/desktop
        . shrink scales the image down to fit one side to the window/desktop
          - squeeze takes precedence over shrink
        . stretch scales the image up to the window/desktop
          - with squeeze it stretches to fit, otherwise it stretches to fill
      - zoom lock is a fixed zoom (!nn% in status bar)
        . zoom lock and squeeze/shrink/stretch disable each other
        . zoom lock can also be cleared by locking at 100%
   b) Scrolling (H:n V:n)
      - the horizontal & vertical scrollable area (arrow keys to scroll)
      - use Shift/Ctrl/Alt keys to alter keyboard scrolling speed
      - left-click mouse to scroll large images
      - left-click and mousewheel scrolls vertically
   c) Rotate rotates the image 90 degrees left/right
      - rotate lock locks the rotation for the slideshow
      - aspect filter only rotates to match the window/desktop aspect ratio
   d) Layout positions the image in a fixed window
      - used to align cropped images in screen corners/borders
   e) Collage overlaps fixed-size roaming position images
      - collage temporarily disables Wrap

4) Exhibit
   a) The root folder and exhibit can be set:
      - with the folder browser (Exhibit->Folder)
      - by dropping a folder onto ArtSage
      - by dropping a single file in the folder onto ArtSage

   b) Temporary exhibits can be set:
      - with the Find->Filter function
      - with the View->Favorites/Desktop/Archive options
      - with the View->Image Folder/Link Target options
      - View->Exhibit redisplays the main exhibit without reloading (or verifying)

   c) The main exhibit can be temporarily altered:
      - by dropping a group of files/folders onto ArtSage
      - by appending images (SHIFT+drop/select)

   d) Exhibit->Refresh(Ctrl+R) reloads the main exhibit from the root folder
      - any appended images are released
      - auto refresh refreshes on any file/folder change in the current view
      - View->Exhibit displays the last unfiltered main exhibit (may require refresh)

   e) Shortcuts (shell links) can be used in place of files/folders
      - shortcuts are created using Favorites->Send ShortCut/Shortcut To Desktop
      - shortcut names are prepended with an asterisk (*filename.lnk)
      - file operations (eg Delete) on shortcuts affect the shortcut only

   f) Find/Filter and Find Next search within the current exhibit
      - to begin a new search, return to View->Exhibit, View->Favorites, etc

   g) File search (loading exhibit)
      - the file search peeks ahead for incremental search and display
      - while searching, the exhibit can be sorted but not altered
        . Find/Filter will find but not filter
        . no switching to favorites, desktop, archive or current image folder

   h) Sorting by path/filename can be done 3 ways
      - Tree: some symbols (eg digits) precede the path separator(\)
      - Tree strict: the path separator(\)precedes all but ! (slower)
      - Name: basic pathname sort that does not preserve the folder tree
      - case sensitive sorts are faster than case insensitive

5) Catalog
   a) Navigate with arrow keys, PageUp, PageDown, Home, End
   b) Shift+[A/F/D/F9] to view Exhibit/Favorites/Desktop/Archive
   c) Space/Backspace for next/previous folder, Shift+F5 to descend
   d) Supports block archive, recycle and favorite
      - Shift selects a range, Ctrl adds with mouse click
   e) Supports block drag/drop and cut/copy/paste
      - Drag/drop/paste to thumbnail folder or root (target shows in status bar)
   f) Autorefresh is always activated for the catalog
      - it may be paused if too frequent but is reactivated by file operations

6) Shell:
   a) Copy, Paste and Save: all use the current image settings (zoom etc)
      - Copy Image includes the offscreen portion
      - Copy View copies only the visible portion (crops the image)
   b) Wallpaper uses the current image settings (optional with Blackbox)
   c) Blackbox: ArtSage detects if Blackbox is the shell
      - The caption/window height adjustments are for bbLeanSkin
      - Smart Wallpaper lets Blackbox handle backgrounds
      - Unscaled smart wallpaper does not write to artpaper.bmp

7) Portable ArtSage: edit the artsage.ini [Portable] section
   - set "savefolder=FALSE" (or use the "Settings->Save Folder" menu option)
   - use relative paths for the file and tools

8) Misc:
   a) Transition latencies can be tuned in the settings file
   b) File read errors are logged to "errors.log"
      - Usually due to a corrupted file header that GDI+ can't handle
      - Loading and saving with a graphics editor usually fixes this
      - May also be due to a stale shortcut

* Option available from command line only

Examples:
  artsage64 -slide -crop -windowed -t2000 "C:\Users\Public"
  artsage64 -fullscreen -noscreenname -z50 -screenroam .\
  artsage64 -nosqueeze -shrink -stretch -r90 -aspect


Autorun CD/USB Drive
--------------------
To make an autorun CD, create the file "autorun.inf" containing these 3 lines:

[autorun]
open=artsage64.exe -slide .\
icon=artsage64.exe

Copy autorun.inf to the CD root directory, together with artsage.exe. Your photos can be in the root directory or in subfolders. You can use command line options. You should also copy this (ArtSage.txt) help file to the CD.


File Associations
-----------------
ArtSage does not associate JPG files with itself. You can do this manually by right-clicking a .jpg and using the "Open With" option: select "Choose Program..." and browse to ArtSage.

If you check the "Always use the selected program [etc....]" box, ArtSage will become the default viewer, otherwise it will simply remain in the "Open With" list. (You can control any file extension this way.)

You can also place a shortcut to ArtSage in the "Send To" menu for easy access. Or, best of all, use a file manager that lets you associate ArtSage with a function key.
